This is a django project written for personal use.  It can and will execute 
arbitrary programs, and is thus dangerous.  As written, it executes all 
commands with the priveleges of the web server, which in my use is as my
user.

Features include execution and the return of standard out of commands, with
optional background execution via the & character, much like in unix shells.
There is also a file manager, which provides navigation, image viewing, file 
deletion, and text editing when coupled with codemirror 
(http://codemirror.net/).  The codemirror files are not included in this 
project.
